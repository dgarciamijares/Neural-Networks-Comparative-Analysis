* **Training Process:** The Keras model is trained using built-in functions for compiling the model, fitting the data, and evaluating performance.

### Hybrid Fossil-Fuel Gas Turbine Analysis

* **Data Collection:** Data for the turbine's operation was collected, cleaned, and normalized to ensure consistency and accuracy in model training.

* **Model Training:** Multiple neural network architectures were tested to find the optimal configuration for predicting turbine performance. The training process involved adjusting hyperparameters and evaluating model performance on a validation set.

* **Prediction and Evaluation:** The trained model's predictions were compared to actual turbine performance data to assess accuracy. The results were analyzed to identify areas where the model performed well and where improvements could be made.

## Results

### Part 1: Neural Network Comparison
* **Performance:** The Keras-based neural network demonstrated superior performance in terms of training speed and accuracy compared to the custom-built network. This was largely due to the optimizations and advanced algorithms implemented in the Keras library.

* **Accuracy:** While both models achieved comparable accuracy in predictions, the Keras model was slightly more accurate, likely due to the more efficient handling of gradients and activation functions.
