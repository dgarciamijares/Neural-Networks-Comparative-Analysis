# Neural-Networks-Comparative-Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis and comparison between a First Principle Neural Network and a Keras-based Neural Network, particularly focusing on their application in predicting the performance of a Hybrid Fossil-Fuel Gas Turbine.The study is divided into two primary parts:

1. **First Principle Neural Network vs. Keras Python Software:**

This section delves into the theoretical and practical differences between a neural network built from first principles and one developed using the Keras framework. The focus is on understanding the core mechanics of neural networks and evaluating the performance of these two approaches in a controlled setting.

2. **Prediction Analysis for a Hybrid Fossil-Fuel Gas Turbine:**

This part of the project applies machine learning neural networks to predict the operational performance of a hybrid fossil-fuel gas turbine. The aim is to demonstrate how advanced neural network models can be employed to enhance predictive maintenance and operational efficiency in industrial applications.

## Motivation

With the growing reliance on machine learning for predictive analytics, especially in industrial and energy sectors, it's essential to understand the strengths and limitations of different neural network architectures. This project seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by comparing two distinct approaches to neural network design and implementation.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Core programming language used for developing and implementing the models.
* **Keras:** A high-level neural network API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, for building and training the neural networks.
* **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations and handling multi-dimensional arrays.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **SciPy:** Leveraged for scientific and technical computing.

## Project Structure

* **Task 1:** Development of a First Principle Neural Network and its comparison with a Keras-based Neural Network.
* **Task 2:** Application of the developed models to predict the performance of a Hybrid Fossil-Fuel Gas Turbine.

## Key Findings

* The First Principle Neural Network offers more transparency in terms of understanding the underlying mechanics of the model. However, it is more time-consuming to develop and may not be as flexible or efficient as using Keras for large-scale applications.
* The Keras-based Neural Network, while more abstracted, allows for rapid development and tuning of complex models. It also integrates seamlessly with other machine learning tools and libraries.
* The predictive analysis of the gas turbine demonstrated the practical applicability of neural networks in enhancing operational efficiency and predictive maintenance in industrial settings.

## Visuals

The project includes several visualizations that compare the performance of the First Principle and Keras-based neural networks, as well as the predictive accuracy for the gas turbine model. These visualizations are crucial for understanding the nuances between different modeling approaches.
